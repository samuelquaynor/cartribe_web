CarTribe MVP 1 — Product Deep Dive
Internal Prototype (with Minimal Auth)
1. Purpose

MVP 1 exists to prove that CarTribe’s core experience makes sense in real use — that a person can list a car, someone else can discover it, and a simple booking flow can happen naturally.

This version isn’t about technology, branding, or growth. It’s about confirming that the core interactions feel right:

Listing feels simple.

Browsing feels natural.

Booking feels clear and satisfying.

It’s our first attempt to see the “heartbeat” of CarTribe working.

2. The Core Idea

CarTribe MVP 1 is a tiny, working version of the entire concept.
It has real users, real listings, and real bookings — just without money, verification, or polish.

We’re testing behavior, not performance.
We want to see if the platform feels intuitive before we build on it.

3. Who Will Use It

This version is for internal testers only — the core team, a few trusted colleagues, and possibly close friends who understand what’s being tested.

Each person will take on one or both of these roles:

Owner: someone who lists a car.

Renter: someone who browses and books a car.

Our goal isn’t numbers — it’s insight.
Every action taken in MVP 1 is feedback on whether the flow is clear.

4. What MVP 1 Should Do
A. Listing

An owner should be able to open the product and, without instructions, understand how to list a car.
It should feel light, almost conversational:

Add the car name, type, description, and when it’s available.

Save, see it appear immediately, and feel ownership over it.

The act of listing should make the owner think, “That was easier than I expected.”

B. Browsing

A renter should see all cars on one main screen.
It should look open and welcoming — like a space full of potential.

They can scroll, tap a car, and quickly get a sense of:

What kind of car it is.

Who owns it.

Whether it’s available.

The key emotion here is curiosity.
The renter should feel drawn in — not overwhelmed by options or text.

C. Booking

Once a renter chooses a car, booking should feel direct and human:

One action to request it.

One simple status (“Request sent”).

The owner sees it, accepts or rejects, and both sides see the result.

No payments, no documents — just a clean, minimal version of the real flow.
When the booking is accepted, both sides should feel like something meaningful just happened.

5. What We’re Observing

During internal testing, we’ll focus on five questions:

Clarity – Do people immediately understand what to do next?

Confidence – Do owners feel comfortable listing their car?

Simplicity – Does the booking process feel effortless?

Visibility – Do users feel informed after every action (request sent, confirmed, etc.)?

Emotion – Does it already feel like CarTribe — modern, personal, and trustworthy?

6. Expected User Flow

Sign in – user enters a name or email.

Choose a role – Owner or Renter.

Owner: Lists a car → sees it live.

Renter: Browses → selects → sends booking request.

Owner: Sees request → accepts or rejects.

Both: See the booking status update.

That’s the entire heartbeat of MVP 1.
Everything else will grow from this foundation.

7. What Success Looks Like

Success for MVP 1 is not perfect visuals or zero bugs — it’s clarity of flow.
If internal users can move through the experience confidently, we’ve achieved the goal.

Signs of success:

Everyone can complete a booking without external guidance.

Testers describe it as “simple” or “obvious.”

Owners list multiple cars just to see how it feels.

Bookings feel like real interactions — even without payments.

8. Why This Matters

If MVP 1 feels natural and satisfying, the rest of the roadmap becomes predictable.
Every later layer — payments, insurance, experiences — will build on the same emotional foundation:

Ease, clarity, and connection.

Without that, no amount of design or engineering can make CarTribe work.

9. Internal Usage Plan

Phase 1: Each team member tests both roles (list + book).

Phase 2: Collect reactions — friction points, emotions, missing cues.

Phase 3: Adjust flow and language based on real feedback before building MVP 2.

We’re testing feel, not scale.

10. Core Guideline for MVP 1

“If someone on the team opens CarTribe for the first time and knows what to do without asking, MVP 1 has succeeded.”
